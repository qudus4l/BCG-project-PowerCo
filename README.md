# BCG-project-PowerCo

PowerCo has had declining profits due to significant customer churn. We have been engaged to drive churn reduction within their Small & Medium Enterprise (SME) customers.

This project is designed to give you a feel of what it is like to work at BCG GAMMA as we help its clients using data science.

The project would include the following:

1. **Business understanding & problem framing:** Understanding the context of the customer and the problem theyâ€™re trying to solve with data.

2. **Exploratory data analysis & data cleaning:** Understanding the customer's data and its statistical properties, as well as preparing a dataset for further analysis.

3. **Feature engineering:** Using business context and expertise to create new data that may provide useful signals in the prediction of outcomes.

4. **Modeling and evaluation:** Using your engineered dataset to model an outcome and generate predictions. Then, testing these predictions against the ground truth to see whether they are reliable.

5. **Insights & Recommendations:** Turning the insights of this analysis into business decisions and recommendations.
